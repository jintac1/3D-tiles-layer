# 3D-tiles

[3D Tiles](https://www.ogc.org/standard/3dtiles/) similar to [i3s](https://www.ogc.org/standard/i3s/) is an OGC standard representing large amounts of geographica 3D data. This repo provides ESRI vendor extensions and tooling related to 3D Tiles.

## Features

- [ESRI_CRS extension](./ESRI_CRS/Esri_crs_extension.md) to specify coordinate reference system.
- Executable to create [3tz_packager (\*.3tz)](./3tz_packager/3tz_packager_ReadMe.md) from a given 3D tiles dataset.

## Requirements

- None

## Resources

- [3tz_packager (\*.3tz)](./3tz_packager/3tz_packager_ReadMe.md)
- [Sample service with ESRI_CRS extension](https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/HjGkPojhRLJzlfAa/arcgis/rest/services/Trakai_Island_Castle/3DTilesServer/tileset.json). This data was collected by [Hnit-Baltic](https://www.gisbaltic.eu/en-gb/home) and [GeoNovus](https://www.geonovus.lt/) and processed with [ArcGIS Reality](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-reality/overview). You can also view the Trakai Island Castle as [Gaussian splat layer](https://scenelayersteam.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=d3624736fdd443a59ec627f3e9924941).
